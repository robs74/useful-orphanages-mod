This mod buffs orphanages to make them actually necessary in your games.

1. When there are no orphanages in your republic or they are full, there is a chance of a negative event (a child dies on a street due to no free beds in orphanages) which greatly reduces your citizens' happiness and loyalty.
2. Orphanages no longer penalize you so hard when the number of children is big but still lower than their capacity. With this script, as long as your orphanages are adequately supplied and not truly overcrowded, orphans' happiness cannot decrease below 50%, criminality cannot increase above 5% and loyalty cannot decrease below the loyalty of the least loyal worker in the orphanage.
3. The script also makes orphans age more quickly and forces them out of the orphanage as soon as they turn 18.

This mod includes a settings file to change some parameters or disable some features. You can find it here: Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\784150\2972012514\settings.txt

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left-hand side of the screen. You can also turn the script off.

This requires further testing and balancing.

Warning: If you reload your game without quitting the game or at least returning to the main menu, the script will be duplicated. If this happens, simply run the turn off script until you are only running one instance.
